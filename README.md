# What-are-bail-bonds-



A bail bond allows a defendant to pay the jail in order to be released from jail before their court date. The defendant must remain in jail until they are able to pay bail if they cannot afford it.

You have the option to pay the entire bail amount yourself in many cases and jurisdictions. Many offenses have very low bond amounts. The jail may accept credit card payments. In this case, the defendant can also charge the amount as a fee.

It is possible to pay the full amount of the bail but it can be difficult to find a way for the defendant to pay the jail. Often, your personal items are taken when you are taken into custody. As evidence, large amounts of cash could be taken. Some jails won't accept credit cards. There is often a significant fee if they accept credit cards.

A bail agent can also be contacted by defendants. Many people choose this option because they only have to pay a small portion upfront for the agency. Friends and relatives of defendants may be able to contact bail agents on their behalf.

A contract will be written by a bail bondman or agent if you hire one. This contract will outline your obligations to the defendant and make sure that they appear in court. You will be held responsible for all bail amounts if the defendant fails to appear.
